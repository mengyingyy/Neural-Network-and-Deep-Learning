# Neural-Network-and-Deep-Learning
This respo covers all my work of deep learning course from Georgetown Univeristy.
## HW 1: 
Regularization.Using the accompanying Hitters dataset, explore regression models to predict a playerâ€™s Salary from other variables.  
### 1.1
Use LASSO regression to predict Salary from the other numeric predictors.Create a visualization of the coefficient trajectories.Comment on which are thefinal three predictors that remain in the model. Use cross-validation to find the optimal value of the regularization penality.How many predictors are left inthat model?
### 1.2
Repeat with Ridge Regression.Visualize coeffecient trajectories. Use cross-validation to find the optimal vaule of the regularization penalty.
